# My n8n Workflow Showcase

Welcome to my n8n workflow showcase! This repository is dedicated to demonstrating my skills and experience in designing and implementing automation solutions using n8n.io.

The primary goal here is to illustrate my approach to problem-solving, workflow logic, API integration, and data manipulation within the n8n ecosystem, rather than providing directly downloadable or executable workflows. Each project folder contains a detailed `README.md` explaining the specific workflow, accompanied by illustrative screenshots.

## My n8n Skills

I have experience working with a variety of n8n features and concepts, including:

* **Core Nodes:** Proficient use of essential nodes like HTTP Request, Function, IF, Switch, Merge, Set, Edit Fields, etc.
* **AI & Langchain Nodes:** Integration with AI models (OpenAI, Google Gemini), Langchain Agents, Memory, and custom tools.
* **API Integration:** Connecting to and interacting with diverse RESTful and GraphQL APIs (e.g., WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API, Notion API, Google Workspace APIs).
* **Data Transformation:** Manipulating JSON data, using expressions, and writing custom JavaScript in Function/Function Item nodes for complex data operations.
* **Workflow Logic:** Designing robust and scalable workflows with conditional branching, error handling, and clear data flow.
* **Triggers & Webhooks:** Setting up workflows triggered by webhooks (e.g., Telegram, WhatsApp), cron jobs (schedules), and app-specific events.
* **Credential Management:** Securely managing API keys and credentials within n8n.
* **Multimedia Handling:** Processing and routing different media types like audio, video, and images within workflows.

## Showcased Workflows

Below is a list of the n8n workflows documented in this repository. Click on each link to navigate to the detailed documentation and screenshots for that specific project.

* **[WhatsApp AI Dental Clinic Assistant & Multimedia Processor](./ai-dental-assistant/README.md)**
    * *An advanced AI-powered assistant for a dental clinic via WhatsApp, handling various media types, and integrating with Google Calendar, Sheets, and Gmail.*
* **[Telegram AI Assistant for "Matrix - Trading Matematico"](./telegram-notion-kb-agent/README.md)**
    * *An AI agent on Telegram providing authorized user support for the "Matrix - Trading Matematico" project, using a Notion knowledge base and Google Sheets for user verification.*

## Technologies I Frequently Work With

While n8n is the core automation platform, I often integrate it with various services and technologies, such as:

* **Communication:** WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot API, Slack, Gmail
* **AI/ML:** OpenAI (GPT models, Whisper), Google Gemini, Langchain
* **Productivity & Collaboration:** Google Workspace (Sheets, Calendar, Drive), Notion
* **Databases & Storage:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Airtable, Supabase


## How to Navigate This Repository

This repository is organized with each major n8n workflow showcased in its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you will find:

* A `README.md` file providing a comprehensive description of that specific workflow.
* Image files (screenshots) referenced in the README to illustrate the workflow structure.
